# Title: A virtual 2-Dimensional (2D) digital Ultrasound machine (Version 1.0)

• To better appreciate and compare the different modalities, in the ultrasound scanner you
will use the same phantom you used in your X-rays Assignment 1

• Below there are some numbered questions; in your report include the corresponding
answers. You can implement this code from scratch (any language you want!) or on
Python or MATLAB.

Objective:
Implement a piece of code that simulates the operation of an Ultrasound (US) virtual scanner.
Phantom-Virtual Human: This is a rectangle with a trapezoid organ inside it. Use the same
exactly phantom you used in your Assignment 1

Ultrasound probe: this is a single crystal probe (i.e. it emits and detects only 1 US beam.

Question-1: In this project, you want to produce a 2D image of the phantom. (a) How can you do
that with a single beam US probe? (b) Make a simple diagram of the hardware components
involved with the receiver channel of the Ultrasound probe.

Question-2: Assignments 1 and 2 have same phantoms and similar scanner setups: why does
one produce a 1D image and the other 2D images?

Question-3: How many parameters are needed to be defined for this phantom to be used in
ultrasound?

Question-4: (a) What determines the resolution of your 2D image (link to the answers of
Questions 1(a) and 1(b))? (b) How can you adjust it?

Input to your code is:
The resolution of the Ultrasound scanner
The specific shape and size of the virtual human and the layers of the body with different
parameters needed to describe the interaction for ultrasound with the virtual patient. You can
use values either from the literature or your own set! But you must be careful with the units!

Output of your code is:
The 2D US image of the virtual patient
Question 4: How should you modify your code so that you can generate the ultrasound image
from a virtual human with 30 organs?
